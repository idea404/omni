# Introduction

## What problem is Omni solving?

Omni answers a simple question -- in an increasingly fragmented blockchain ecosystem, how do developers access all of web3's users?

Today, developers seeking to build decentralized applications are currently forced to choose a single ecosystem on which to deploy their app. This fragments liquidity across ecosystems and inhibits users' ability to utilize these products. It not only hurts end users through adding more complexity to the experience of using decentralized applications, it also hurts developers by making it more difficult for them to acquire new users.

Omni was built to solve this exact problem, it is a platform which allows developers to build applications that are available across all rollups, lowering the friction to acquiring more users.

## How does Omni achieve this?

Omni is a special purpose blockchain built to aggregate users, liquidity and activity from all rollups, providing developers with the best platform to build cross-rollup applications. Through an innovative, modular architecture Omni serves as a fully programmable blockchain that has the added functionality of aggregating state from all rollups. This allows developers to build applications that are available across all rollups without fragmenting their liquidity.

Omni abstracts away the complexity of building cross-rollup applications by establishing a unified global state layer (secured by the use of EigenLayer's restaking mechanism) to manage cross-domain applications, accessing liquidity and users across every ecosystem. Developers can work in a familiar environment – the EVM – and don't need to worry about distributed state management because of the global state management system introduced by Omni. Instead of fragmenting liquidity, application developers can aggregate it across domains, meeting users where they are and creating a smooth product experience.
