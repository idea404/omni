# Building Cross-Rollup Apps

Omni is a bold vision. It is only possible because of a series of recent innovations in blockchain infrastructure. This section provides a high level overview of the "How It Works" and the components that work together to establish the final product. For a more detailed overview, see the Protocol section.

## Restaking

The Omni Network consists of validators who restake $ETH and monitor the state of rollups. These validators relay state updates from one domain to others and provide crypto-economic assurance of validity. This means that the Omni Network is going to be the first platform that provides developers with a global view of state from all rollups, making cross-rollup application development extremely simple. All of this is made possible through the unique insight to use Ethereum's own validator set to aggregate a global perspective of Ethereum's L2 ecosystem.

## EVM Compatibility

Omni not only provides a global view of all rollup state -- it is also a programmable and stateful layer itself, so developers can leverage its lightning fast settlement and secure interoperability to build natively cross-rollup applications. Omni's execution layer is EVM compatible so developers can work in the same environment with which they are familiar. The execution layer includes built-in functionality to access state, messages, and applications from integrated rollups, creating a seamless experience to access users and liquidity across these rollups.

## Global Application Development

Developing decentralized applications in a "global by default" manner will become the standard for teams in the crypto industry. Through providing a seamless experience, Omni empowers developers to build applications that benefit from the low cost of rollups while making it simple for every Web3 user to access their application.
