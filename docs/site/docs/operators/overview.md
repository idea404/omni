# Overview

The Omni Network was designed to fill a gap in Ethereum's rollup centric roadmap. Today, users are scattered across rollups making it simultaneously more difficult for users to explore the latest innovations and for developers to access all of these users. Omni solves this through allowing developers to build applications that are available across all rollups by default, widely expanding their addressable market and abstracting away all complexity like bridging from end users.

Below we provide a brief overview of the core concepts that were prioritized in the development of the Omni Network.

## ETH Restaking

Our goal in building the Omni Network was to fill a missing infrastructure gap in the Ethereum's modular protocol stack, which is why we utilize existing Ethereum validators to provide this functionality. Restaking provides a foundation upon which to build a highly performant network that runs in parallel with the core Ethereum network, excelling in the domains where Ethereum falls short.

## Fast Finality

In order to build decentralized applications capable of onboarding billions of people, we not only need to abstract away the complexity of multiple rollups, we also need to provide users with responsive applications. Through combining the security provided by Ethereum validators with frontier innovations in crypto technologies, the Omni Network is able to both abstract away complexity while providing fast confirmations to users.

## Cross-Rollup Programmability

Omni is designed to be the developer platform for Ethereum's rollup centric roadmap. Many older protocols, like LayerZero, have historically focused on passing messages from one domain to another. Omni empowers developers to natively program in a global by default context, abstracting away the message passing and providing developers with a more powerful programming paradigm. Nobody in web2 today thinks about IP packets being passed around, we have grown accustomed to using powerful tools like React and Kubernetes. Omni provides a comparable leap forward in functionality, establishing the new status quo for decentralized application development.

## Permissionless Expansion

The Omni Network will continue to grow across rollups as more are deployed. This means that application developers will be able to consistently expand their application and addressable user base through a developer experience as simple as appending a single line to a YAML file.
