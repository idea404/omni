Over time, various proposals have attempted to solve this problem: state channels, side chains, and plasma to name a few. However, each of these options came with unfortunate trade-offs that typically sacrificed security to achieve these goals. But their development was not in vain! They led to the growth of rollups, the currently agreed upon optimal solution for scaling Ethereum.","sidebar":"oldSidebar"},"background/settlement":{"id":"background/settlement","title":"Rollup Settlement","description":"Rollups come in two main flavors: optimistic rollups and ZK rollups.

Our goal is to create a thriving ecosystem of powerful applications that abstract away complexity and onboard billions of users into the decentralized economy. Omni achieves this through providing a permissionless and programmable platform that aggregates users and liquidity from all rollups.","sidebar":"oldSidebar"},"omni/vision":{"id":"omni/vision","title":"Vision","description":"Omni is a restaking secured blockchain purpose built to connect all of Ethereum\'s rollups, empowering developers to build apps across all L2s.","sidebar":"oldSidebar"},"operators/overview":{"id":"operators/overview","title":"Network Connection Details","description":"The Omni Overdrive Testnet currently connects 3 different rollup networks, uniting Ethereum\'s L2 ecosystem.

Ethereum is the most decentralized Turing complete computing network in existence. This is an objective reality when measured in terms of geographic distribution, cost to attack and ability to recover from attacks. However, it is simply slow. It also lacks frequent finality.","sidebar":"oldSidebar"},"protocol/overview":{"id":"protocol/overview","title":"Overview","description":"The Omni Network was designed to fill a gap in Ethereum\'s rollup centric roadmap. Today, users are scattered across rollups making it simultaneously more difficult for users to explore the latest innovations and for developers to access all of these users. Omni solves this through allowing developers to build applications that are available across all rollups by default, widely expanding their addressable market and abstracting away all complexity like bridging from end users.","sidebar":"oldSidebar"},"protocol/permissionless":{"id":"protocol/permissionless","title":"Permissionless Expansion","description":"The Omni Network is designed to facilitate permissionless expansion. This is essential in our vision of creating an open and free global economy, but it is also simply pragmatic. In order to provide the most utility to end users, the Omni Network needs a way to be permissionlessly deployed across all rollups. We achieve this through portal contracts.","sidebar":"oldSidebar"},"protocol/programmability":{"id":"protocol/programmability","title":"Cross-Rollup Programmability","description":"The Omni Network does not only facilitate communication across rollups -- it also enables programmability across rollups. This is a brand new, incredibly powerful programming paradigm that over time will become the de facto method of decentralized application development. We did not build Omni so that people could just pass messages across rollups, we created Omni to facilitate an entirely new programming paradigm that allows developers to think globally, not locally.","sidebar":"oldSidebar"},"protocol/restaking":{"id":"protocol/restaking","title":"ETH Restaking","description":"Omni provides a missing, yet essential, infrastructure layer for Ethereum\'s rollup centric future. This is why, when designing the Omni Network, we asked ourselves \\"What would be the best way to empower developers to build applications across all rollups if it was part of the core Ethereum protocol?\\" The answer to this question is to utilize restaking, creating an auxiliary network consisting of existing Ethereum validators who assume additional responsibilities to facilitate this functionality.","sidebar":"oldSidebar"},"resources/glossary":{"id":"resources/glossary","title":"Glossary","description":"Domain","sidebar":"oldSidebar"}}}')}}]);
